# Recoverable Errors with `Result`

Most errors aren't serious enough to require the program to stop entirely. Sometimes when a function fails, it's for a reaspn that you can easily interpret and respond to. For example if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn't exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

The `Result` enum is defined as having two variants, `Ok` and `Err`:

```Rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

The `T` and `E` are generic type parameters: We'll discuss generics in more detail in Chapter 10. What is important is that `T` represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the `Ok` variant, and `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the `Err` variant. Because `Result` has these generic type parameters, we can use the `Result` type and the functions defined on it in many different situations where the success value and error value we want to return may differ.

## Matching on Different Errors

If we want to take different actions for differente failure reasons, we can use inner match expressions... evaluating with the `match error.kind()`

The enum `io::ErrorKind` is provided by the standard library and has variants representing the different kinds of errors that might result from an `io` operation. The variant we want to use is `ErrorKind::NotFound`, which indicates the file we're trying to open doesn't exist yet.

## Shortcuts for Panic on Error

Using `match` works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn't always communicate intent well. The `Result<T, E>` type has many helper methods defined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The `unwrap` method is a shortcut method implemented just like the `match` expression. If the `Result` value is the `Ok` variant, `unwrap` will return the value inside the `Ok`. If the `Result` is the `Err` variant, `unwrap` will call the `panic!` macro for us.

Similarly, the `expect` method lets us also choose the `panic!` error message. Using `expect` instead of `unwrap` and providing good error messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier.

## Propagating Errors

When a function's implementation calls something that might fail, instead of handling the error within the function itself, you can return the error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as *propagating* the error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more information or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than what you have available in the context of your code.

## The ? Operator Shortcut

The `?` placed after a `Result` value is defined to work in almost the same way as the `match` expressions that we defined to handle the `Result` values. If the value of the `Result` is an `Ok`, the value inside the `Ok` will get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the value is an `Err`, the `Err` will be returned from the whole function as if we had used the `return` keyword so that the error value gets propagated to the calling code.

There is a difference between what the `match` expression does and what the `?` operator does: Error values that have the `?` operator called on them go through the `from` function, defined in the `From` trait in the standard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another. When the `?` operator calls the `from` function, the error type received is converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current function. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different reasons.

## Where to use the ? Operator

The `?` operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible with the value the `?` is used on. This is because the `?` operator is defined to perform an early return of a value out of the function, in the same manner as the `match` expression.
