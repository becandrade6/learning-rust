# Closures

Rust's closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions. You can create the closure in one place and then call the closure elsewhere to evaluate it in a different context. Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they're defined. We'll demonstrate how these closure features allow for code reuse and behavior customization.

# Capturing the Environment

Let's first examine how we can use closures to capture values from the environment they're defined in for later use.

The `unwrap_or_else` method on `Option<T>` is defined by the standard library. It takes one argument: a closure without any arguments that returns a value `T` (the same type stored in the `Some` variant of the `Option<T>`, in this case ShirtColor). If the `Option<T>` is the `Some` variant, `unwrap_or_else` returns the value from within the `Some`. If the `Option<T>` is the `None` variant, `unwrap_or_else` calls the closure and returns the value returned by the closure.

We specify the closure expression `|| self.most_stocked()` as the argument to `unwrap_or_else`. This is a closure that takes no parameters itself (if the closure had parameters, they would appear between the two vertical pipes). The body of the closure calls self.`most_stocked()`. We’re defining the closure here, and the implementation of `unwrap_or_else` will evaluate the closure later if the result is needed.

One interesting aspect here is that we’ve passed a closure that calls `self.most_stocked()` on the current `Inventory` instance. The standard library didn’t need to know anything about the `Inventory` or `ShirtColor` types we defined, or the logic we want to use in this scenario. The closure captures an immutable reference to the `self` `Inventory` instance and passes it with the code we specify to the `unwrap_or_else` method. Functions, on the other hand, are not able to capture their environment in this way.

# Inferring and Annotating Closure Types

There are more differences between functions and closures. Closures don't usually require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the return value like `fn` functions do. Type annotations are required on functions because the types are part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Closures, on the other hand, aren't used in an exposed interface like this: They're stored in variables, and they're used without naming them and exposing them to users of our library.

Closures are typically short and relevant only within a narrow context rather than in any arbitrary scenario. Within these limited contexts, the compiler can infer the types of the parameters and the return type, similar to how it's able to infer the types of most variables (there are rare cases where the compiler needs closure type annotations too).

As with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase explicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly necessary. Like this:

```Rust
let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
    println!("calculating slowly...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
};
```

With type annotations added, the syntax of closures looks more similar to the syntax of functions. Here, we define a function that adds 1 to its parameter and a closure that has the same behavior, for comparison. We’ve added some spaces to line up the relevant parts. This illustrates how closure syntax is similar to function syntax except for the use of pipes and the amount of syntax that is optional:

```Rust
fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;
```

# Capturing References or Moving Ownership

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: borrowing immutably, borrowing mutably, and taking ownership. The closure will decide which of these to use based on what the body of the function does with the captured values.

A variable can bind to a closure definition, and we can later call the closure by using the variable name and parentheses as if the variable name were a function name.

If you want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses in the environment even though the body of the closure doesn’t strictly need ownership, you can use the `move` keyword before the parameter list.

This technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move the data so that it’s owned by the new thread.

# Moving Captured Values Out of Closures

Once a closure has captured a reference or captured ownership of a value from the environment where the closure is defined (thus affecting what, if anything, is moved *into* the closure), the code in the body of the closure defines what happens to the references or values when the closure is evaluated later (thus affecting what, if anything, is moved *out* of the closure).

A closure body can do any of the following: Move a captured value out of the closure, mutate the captured value, neither move nor mutate the value, or capture nothing from the environment to begin with.

The way a closure captures and handles values from the environment affects which traits the closure implements, and traits are how functions and structs can specify what kinds of closures they can use. Closures will automatically implement one, two, or all three of these `Fn` traits, in an additive fashion, depending on how the closure's body handles the values:

- `FnOnce` applies to closures that can be called once. All closures implement at least this trait because all closures can be called. A closure that moves captured values out of its body will only implement `FnOnce` and none of the other `Fn` traits because it can only be called one.
- `FnMut` applies to closures that don't move captured values out of their body but might mutate the captured values. These closures can be called more than once.
- `Fn` applies to closures that don't move captured values out of their body and don't mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture nothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once without mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure multiple times concurrently.

> Note: If what we want to do doesn’t require capturing a value from the environment, we can use the name of a function rather than a closure where we need something that implements one of the `Fn` traits. For example, on an `Option<Vec<T>>` value, we could call `unwrap_or_else(Vec::new)` to get a new, empty vector if the value is `None`. The compiler automatically implements whichever of the `Fn` traits is applicable for a function definition.
