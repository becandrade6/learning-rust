We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works: The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won’t change. We’ll be discussing this concept in detail in the [“Variables and Mutability”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability) section in Chapter 3. To make a variable mutable, we add `mut` before the variable name:

```rust
let apples = 5; // immutable 
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```

Note: The `//` syntax starts a comment that continues until the end of the line. Rust ignores everything in comments. We’ll discuss comments in more detail in [Chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-04-comments.html).

The `::` syntax in the `::new` line indicates that `new` is an associated function of the `String` type. An _associated function_ is a function that’s implemented on a type, in this case `String`. This `new` function creates a new, empty string. You’ll find a `new` function on many types because it’s a common name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.

We could have written this code as:

`io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");`

However, one long line is difficult to read, so it’s best to divide it. It’s often wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long lines when you call a method with the `.method_name()` syntax.

Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of `guess` with a new one. _Shadowing_ lets us reuse the `guess` variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as `guess_str` and `guess`, for example. We’ll cover this in more detail in [Chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing), but for now, know that this feature is often used when you want to convert a value from one type to another type.
